/*
Exercise #1:
Write a query that provides row numbers for all workers from the "employees" table, 
partitioning the data by their first names and ordering each partition by their employee number in ascending order.
NB! While writing the desired query, do *not* use an ORDER BY clause in the relevant SELECT statement. 
At the same time, do use a WINDOW clause to provide the required window specification.
